## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Pharmaceuticals}

Pharmaceuticals <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\13308\\OneDrive\\Documents\\64060_-spavliga\\Pharmaceuticals.csv")

#A

data.df <- Pharmaceuticals


data.df <- data.df[,-14]
data.df <- data.df[,-13]
data.df <- data.df[,-12]
data.df <- data.df[,-1]
data.df <- data.df[,-1]
str(data.df)

datanorm <- sapply(data.df, scale)

str(datanorm)

library(factoextra)
library(flexclust)

fviz_nbclust(datanorm, FUNcluster = hcut, method = "wss")

k <- 2

datanormkmeans <- kmeans(datanorm, centers = k)
datanormkmeans

fviz_cluster(datanormkmeans, data = datanorm)

# Based on the results of the fviz_nbclust function (elbow method), 2 clusters  
# appeared to be the best option. Beyond
# preprocessing the data, I took a more straightfoward approach. I just used  
# euclidean distance (default for kmeans()) as given
# the nature of our data, there isn't really a need for anything beyond it.

#B
# As a whole, cluster 1 appears to be characterized by being more profitable and 
# generally healthier than cluster 2. Specifically noting the values of
# Market_Cap, ROE, ROA and Net_Profit_Margin, cluster 1 appears to be better 
# performing than cluster 2. The only exception is Rev_Growth, but 
# Net_Profit_Margin also favors cluster 1.

#C
# There does not appear to be any patterns, however it is worth noting that the 
# 4 "Sells" in median recommendations are split equally between the two clusters. 
# Based on the k-means results, I would have anticipated the "Sells" favoring
# cluster 2. There were no notable findings in location or exchange.

#D
# As a whole, the companies in cluster 1 are characterized by better 
# performances in all areas aside from estimated revenue growth. 
# Overall, I would name cluster 1 "High performing, high profit companies." 
# Cluster 2 is characterized by lower profit margins,
# lower market cap, lower asset turnover, higher beta and so on. While
# the estimated revenue growth does favor cluster 2, only 1 out of 9 variables 
# measured indicates cluster 2 performing better than cluster 1. In contrast to
# cluster 1's name, I would name cluster 2 "Lower performing, lower
# profit companies."
