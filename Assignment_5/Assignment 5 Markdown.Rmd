## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# In review, only 6 out of 20 values were correctly assigned. With a 30%
# accuracy, this is not very consistent and would indicate a rather low
# stability. 

#4 

#I would be inclined to not normalize the data as we are focused on the 
#real-world implications and the real measurements of the variables as opposed 
#to the normalized ones, however it does open up the risk of our results not 
#being entirely correct. Regarding the school lunch example, I am assuming that 
#the cluster or dendrogram info will be given to the lunch staff. I wouldn't 
#expect the lunch staff to know what to do with the normalized values. Being 
#said, some options would be to perform calculations with the normalized data 
#and simply provide the dendrogram results or just provide the cereals that 
#make up the best cluster.

#It would also be possible to avoid clustering entirely and evaluate
#which cereals to choose based off rating, which does appear
#to be representative of the general health of the cereal.
